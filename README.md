# Welcome to 'saltyGacha' Project by SAGUINS
Write in Java programming language. Using if-else, for-loop, switch-case and a little bit about Class. This project can build something more on it, like how often did I get SSR? how often did I get this units?

This project is a prototype of [Overhit Gacha Simulator by GameFever](https://overhit.gamefever.co/gacha/)

## Let's talk about this case.
- 99 units.
- Rarity Probability
  - SSR 2%
  - SR 25%
  - R 73%
- get 10 units per one. Guarantee 1 units that have SR rarity or better.

Enjoy!
